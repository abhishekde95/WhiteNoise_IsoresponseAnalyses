# WhiteNoise_IsoresponseAnalyses


I investigated how cells combine light signals spatially. I collected the neuronal data from individual macaque V1 cells 
using an adaptive closed loop stairacse procedure, and identified the preferred light by the cell using white noise analysis.

I fit the staircase termination points with linear and quadratic models using robust regression, perfrom leave-one-out cross validation and used statistics 
to compare the model fits.
